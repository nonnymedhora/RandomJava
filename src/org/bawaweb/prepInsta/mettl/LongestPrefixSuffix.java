		Longest Prefix Suffix
		
		Given a string of character, find the length of longest proper prefix 
		which is also a proper suffix.

		Input:
		First line is T number of test cases. 1<=T<=100.
		Each test case has one line denoting the string of length less than 100000.
		
		Expected time compexity is O(N).
		
		Output:
		Print length of longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix.
		
		Example:
